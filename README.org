* ibuffer-archive 

An enhancement of ibuffer, to create filter groups based on the archive (e.g. zip or tar) to which a buffer belongs. 

If you love ibuffer (who doesn't?) and frequently deal with zip-based formats, such as XPIs (for firefox extensions) or epubs (for e-books), this might be for you.

ibuffer-archive is inspired by and closely based on [[https://github.com/purcell/ibuffer-vc][ibuffer-vc]].

** Installation and example use

Download `ibuffer-archive.el` and add the following to your `init.el` (or just evaluate it in a `*scratch*` buffer for testing):

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; Installation
(add-to-list 'load-path
	     "/path/to/dir/containing/ibuffer-archive/")

(require 'ibuffer-archive)


;; Example use
(defun set-my-default-ibuffer-filter-groups ()
  "Set my default ibuffer-filter-groups."
  (interactive)
  (setq
   ibuffer-filter-groups
   (append
    ;; Whatever other filter groups you might want to use
    ;; They can be pre-set or also generated
    (ibuffer-archive-generate-filter-groups-by-archive-root)))
  (ibuffer-update nil t))

(add-hook 'ibuffer-hook
	  #'set-my-default-ibuffer-filter-groups)
#+END_SRC
